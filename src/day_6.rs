// --- Day 6: Lanternfish ---

// The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?

// A massive school of glowing lanternfish swims past. They must spawn quickly to
// reach such large numbers - maybe exponentially quickly? You should model their
// growth rate to be sure.

// Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make
// some guesses about their attributes. Surely, each lanternfish creates a new
// lanternfish once every 7 days.

// However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish -
// one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish,
// while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that
// represents the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish.

// Furthermore, you reason, a new lanternfish would surely need slightly longer
// before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first
// cycle.

// So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of 3:

//     After one day, its internal timer would become 2.
//     After another day, its internal timer would become 1.
//     After another day, its internal timer would become 0.
//     After another day, its internal timer would reset to 6, and it would create
//     a new lanternfish with an internal timer of 8.
//     After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of 5,
//     and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of 7.

// A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to 6, not 7 (because 0 is
// included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts with an internal
// timer of 8 and does not start counting down until the next day.

// Realizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically produces a list
// of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input). For
// example, suppose you were given the following list:

// 3,4,3,1,2

// This list means that the first fish has an internal timer of 3, the second fish
// has an internal timer of 4, and so on until the fifth fish, which has an
// internal timer of 2. Simulating these fish over several days would proceed as
// follows:

// Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2
// After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
// After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
// After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
// After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
// After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
// After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
// After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
// After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
// After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
// After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
// After 11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8
// After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8
// After 13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8
// After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
// After 15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7
// After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8
// After 17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8
// After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8

// Each day, a 0 becomes a 6 and adds a new 8 to the end of the list, while each
// other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of the day.

// In this example, after 18 days, there are a total of 26 fish. After 80 days,
// there would be a total of 5934.

// Find a way to simulate lanternfish. How many lanternfish would there be after 80
// days?

// --- Part Two ---

// Suppose the lanternfish live forever and have unlimited food and space. Would
// they take over the entire ocean?

// After 256 days in the example above, there would be a total of 26984457539
// lanternfish!

// How many lanternfish would there be after 256 days?
